      The Santa Barbara Zoo is excited to officially reopen to the public on June 23, by online reservation only. While guests can expect temporary changes at the Zoo that comply with guidelines outlined by local and state health authorities, they will once again be able to explore the wonders of wildlife with their families, take part in fun, educational activities, and have the chance to meet the Zoo’s newest residents - two African lions. A male named Ralph and a female named Felicia arrived on May 6, and have a breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
